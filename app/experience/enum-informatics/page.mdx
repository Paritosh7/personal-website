# Engineering Frontends at Enum Informatics

Enum was my launchpad. It’s where I first saw code running in the wild, where my UI broke in production—and I learned to fix it fast.

---

## Systems that Scale

### Component Libraries That Work

- Built a reusable component library in **React**—the same buttons, inputs, and layouts powered multiple enterprise products
- This wasn’t about DRY code—it was about speed, consistency, and developer happiness

### Optimised Delivery

- Implemented **Code Splitting**, cutting down first-load times and giving users that instant app feel
- Configured UAT environments on client servers so QA could test _real_ builds, not just developer dreams

---

## Developer Workflow

- Set up Git-based pipelines and structured code reviews
- Worked with teams across time zones—deployments had to be smooth, no 2 AM hotfixes
- Practiced Agile without the buzzwords: just small iterations, tight feedback loops, and working software

---

## Habits That Lasted

Enum taught me the rhythms of production engineering. From estimations to releases, I learned to build for change and plan for breakage.
